# Migration Guide

This document lists breaking changes across all bundled features.
Use `kumiko upgrade` to check what's new since your current version.

## 0.165.0

### user-data-rights

**Export download: removed ?token= query param**

GET /user-export/by-token no longer accepts the token as a query parameter. Only POST body (read from URL fragment) is supported now. Old email links with ?token= in the URL will stop working.

**Migration:** Replace any existing export links that use ?token= in the URL with POST-based links. The token is now only read from the URL fragment (#token), which browsers never send to the server.

### config

**Reencrypt job: removed legacy-decrypt path**

The old single-key format (CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY) is no longer supported. The reencrypt job now classifies rows as rotate/current/unrecognized — unreadable rows are counted as failed instead of silently attempted.

**Migration:** If any config values still exist in the old single-key format, re-encrypt them with the current envelope format before upgrading. The job will now throw an error instead of attempting migration.

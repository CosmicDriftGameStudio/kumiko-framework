# Migration Guide

This document lists breaking changes across all bundled features.
Use `kumiko upgrade` to check what's new since your current version.

## 0.166.0

### document-ingest-foundation

**documentExtract.pages: tenantOwned instead of encrypted, and the feature now requires tenant-lifecycle**

`pages` holds the full extracted text of ingested documents (invoices, IDs, contracts) and was `encrypted: true` — app-master-key ciphertext with no erasure subject, so no Art. 17 path could ever make it unreadable. It is now `tenantOwned: true`, which binds it to the tenant subject key that tenant-destroy's eraseSubjectKeys shreds. The feature registers an EXT_TENANT_DATA destroy hook for it, and since tenant-lifecycle hosts that extension point, `document-ingest-foundation` now declares it as a hard requirement — mounting the feature without tenant-lifecycle (plus its own tenant + compliance-profiles requires) makes createRegistry throw (#1621).

**Migration:** Mount createTenantFeature(), createComplianceProfilesFeature() and createTenantLifecycleFeature() alongside documentIngestFoundationFeature. Rows written before this version carry master-key envelope ciphertext that the subject-decrypt path does not recognise — readIngestPages returns [] for them. There is no reencrypt job; if you have existing extracts you care about, decrypt and rewrite them before upgrading.

## 0.165.0

### user-data-rights

**Export download: removed ?token= query param**

GET /user-export/by-token no longer accepts the token as a query parameter. Only POST body (read from URL fragment) is supported now. Old email links with ?token= in the URL will stop working.

**Migration:** Replace any existing export links that use ?token= in the URL with POST-based links. The token is now only read from the URL fragment (#token), which browsers never send to the server.

### config

**Reencrypt job: removed legacy-decrypt path**

The old single-key format (CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY) is no longer supported. The reencrypt job now classifies rows as rotate/current/unrecognized — unreadable rows are counted as failed instead of silently attempted.

**Migration:** If any config values still exist in the old single-key format, re-encrypt them with the current envelope format before upgrading. The job will now throw an error instead of attempting migration.

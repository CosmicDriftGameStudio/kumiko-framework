### Patch Changes

- 2ae49bc: The workspace link of `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-samples` now shows the published layout. `packages/samples/{samples,packages}` hold checked-in relative symlinks to the repo sources, so a consumer that resolves `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-samples/package.json` in a workspace finds `samples/recipes`, `samples/apps` and `packages/bundled-features` next to it. `prepack` swaps the symlinks for the filtered real copies and `postpack` restores them. The published tarball is unchanged.

  title: Workspace link of kumiko-samples shows the published layout through checked-in symlinks
  detail: |
    `scripts/stage-samples-package.ts` declares the shipped layout once. `stage` replaces the symlinks with filtered copies for packing, `clean` removes the copies and restores the symlinks. `verify-samples-package.sh` now expects the symlinks, not an empty folder, after packing.

### Minor Changes

- b036209: New package with the sample recipes, sample apps and bundled-features sources

  `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-samples` ships the sample recipes, sample apps and bundled-features sources in the repository layout. Tools such as the few-shot corpus build can run against a pinned version of it and get the same entry ids and source paths as in the monorepo.

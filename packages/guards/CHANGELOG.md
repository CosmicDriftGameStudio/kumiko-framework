- 2f17bcb: Export the three suite runners so a CLI can compose them in-process

  runGuardsCli, runUiGuardsCli and runRepoChecksCli (plus their flag lists and cliFlagsError) were only reachable from their own runner modules, so a caller had to spawn three subprocesses — each building its own ts-morph project. They are part of the package entry point now, which lets `kumiko check` run all three over one shared project in a single process.

- 9b16fe2: New Raw section.fields Guard

  The boot-validator enforces `fields` XOR `groups` on edit sections, so a section carrying `groups` has `fields: []` — every reader that iterates `section.fields` walks an empty list there and silently sees no field at all. That same cause produced three independent regressions (kumiko-framework#2986, then the boot-guard and the E2E generator in #3042). The new guard flags for-of, spread and array reads over a section's `fields` in the layer where a section is a spec (framework engine/i18n/testing, headless, renderer app shims) and points at `sectionFieldSpecs(section)`, the one reader that unions both sources. A deliberate raw reader declares itself with `// kumiko-lint-ignore section-fields-raw <reason>` on the line or the line above — a bare tag without a reason stays a finding, so there is no silent exception list. `section.fields.length` is a known gap: the fields-XOR-groups validator itself needs it and an emptiness check is not the silent-iteration bug. Ratcheted against `.kumiko-section-fields-raw-baseline.json`, warning-only in a repo that has not frozen one yet.

- b59f1d5: Fix false-positive BLOCK in the Direct-Entity-Writes Guard for repos with no event store

  An empty `esTables` set had one meaning: the scan lost track of ES definitions while table-write code still exists, so the guard reported a misconfiguration canary and blocked (the guard is `security: true`, so this always failed CI). That conflated two different situations: a repo with no event store at all (e.g. `kumiko-platform`, an Astro docs/marketing site) also has an empty `esTables` set, but there is nothing to guard against there. The guard now checks whether any table write is present at all before treating an empty `esTables` set as a misconfiguration; a repo with no ES and no table writes is green, while a repo with table writes but no resolvable ES tables still blocks as before.

### Minor Changes

- 8ee38b3: Add a `tooling` repo kind, scoped out of guards by default

  `kumiko-repo-manifest`'s `repoKindSchema` gains a `"tooling"` value for a repo with no product code (infra, Pulumi, build tooling). `kumiko-guards`' `scanRoots` treats an omitted `ScanSpec.kinds` as "every root except tooling" instead of "every root" — only 7 of ~60 guards declare `kinds` today, so without this a tooling repo would have been silently pulled into every product-oriented guard; a guard now has to name `"tooling"` in `kinds` explicitly to scan one. Separately, `kumiko-framework`'s boot-validator now includes the implicit parent-id field in a form screen's `urlPrefillFields` when it's reached via a relatedList toolbarAction that declares no `params` of its own — the renderer already sends that field (`parentFilter.field`, else `parentParam`, else `"id"`), the boot-validator just wasn't allowlisting it.

- 4880f4e: Fix Direct-Fetch Guard allowlist after egress moved to kumiko-http

  The ALLOWLIST regex still pointed at the old packages/framework/src/http/egress.ts path; egress() now lives in packages/http/src/egress.ts (@cosmicdrift/kumiko-http), so the guard was about to self-flag its own allowed implementation as a raw-fetch violation.

### Patch Changes

- 31540a6: Escape-Hatch-Declared Guard resolves module-local const reasons instead of forcing duplicate literals

  `_lib/generic-reason.ts`'s `literalReasonText` only accepted a string/template literal in place — an Identifier (even a module-local `const SOME_REASON = "..."`) fell through as "not statically judgeable" and was rejected exactly like a real placeholder. Every consumer declaring several hooks with the same justification (e.g. publicstatus's five GDPR delete hooks) had to repeat the same reason text literally in each `declareEscapeHatch({ reason })` / `escapeHatch: { reason }` / `unsafeAllTenants: { reason }` / `acknowledgeCrossTenant(reason)` call, because a shared constant made the guard fail.

  The guard now resolves an Identifier to a module-local `const` initializer (string or non-templated template literal only — no imports, no `let`, no reassignment) via a new `resolveReasonText`, used at all four call sites; `isGenericReason` is unchanged and still applies to the resolved text, so a const resolving to `"todo"` is rejected exactly as before. An import, a function call, or a template literal with substitutions still doesn't resolve, and the `unsafe-raw-outside-system-scope` / `system-identity-outside-declared-scope` findings now say why when a nearby `declareEscapeHatch` call's reason is one of those three shapes. Both R2 and R3's base messages now also name `declareEscapeHatch({ reason: "..." })` as a direct body statement of a named hook among the allowed ways to clear the finding.

### Minor Changes

- 73b5efe: New `kumiko-guards list` subcommand prints the registration inventory (which guards/checks are registered, under which names, in which suite) as JSON, without scanning or running anything. The public package has one bin with `guards|ui|checks` subcommands instead of a bin per guard, so a consumer's CI can no longer check "does this binary exist" per guard — `list` is what it checks against instead, e.g. `bunx kumiko-guards list | jq '.suites.guards.count'`.

- 7681005: Port the upgrade-state and runtime-isolation guards

  guard-upgrade-state and check-runtime-isolation ported from the private infra/guards package into the public @cosmicdrift/kumiko-guards package, rebuilt onto the public RepoCheck pattern with single-repo root resolution. guard-app-dockerfile, guard-doc-status, check-licenses, and check-security stay in infra/guards as CDGS-specific house rules (private registry scope, CDGS doc taxonomy, and CDGS license/security exception files with no equivalent consumer-facing mechanism in the public package) — they were deliberately not ported, not forgotten.

### Patch Changes

- a5965ff: `kumiko-guards guards` now accepts `--explain`, `--write-security-baseline`, and `--strict-security-baseline`

  The `kumiko-guards` bin's `guards` subcommand only ran `process.argv[2]` for the subcommand name and never passed the rest of `argv` into the suite it dispatched to, so `--write-security-baseline` and the other run-guards.ts flags were silently ignored when invoked through the published bin — the only way to reach them was a direct `node_modules/@cosmicdrift/kumiko-guards/src/run-guards.ts` file-path call. Each suite's flag handling now lives in one `run*Cli(argv)` function shared by the bin and the suite's own direct-invocation block, and any argument that isn't an exact match for that subcommand's known flags — a single-dash typo, a stray positional, anything — fails with the flags that subcommand actually understands instead of being ignored.

  <!-- kumiko-changes
  feature: guards
  type: fix
  title: kumiko-guards bin now passes flags through to the guards, ui, and checks subcommands
  detail: The bin's `guards` subcommand called run-guards.ts's suite runner directly, skipping the `--explain`/`--write-security-baseline`/`--strict-security-baseline` handling that only existed in run-guards.ts's own `if (import.meta.main)` block — a consumer running `bunx @cosmicdrift/kumiko-guards guards --write-security-baseline` got a normal guard run with the flag silently dropped. Each suite (guards, ui, checks) now exports a `run*Cli(argv)` function that validates argv against that suite's known flags and applies them; both the bin and the suite's own direct-invocation entry point call the same function, so they cannot drift apart again. Validation matches each arg exactly against the known list (not just a `--`-prefix check), so a single-dash typo or a stray positional also exits 1 with the flags that subcommand accepts, rather than passing through unnoticed.

- c74f155: `bunx @cosmicdrift/kumiko-guards` is now runnable: a new `src/cli.ts` entry runs all three suites (guards, UI guards, repo checks) in one process and exits 1 if any of them reports a violation, or runs a single suite via `kumiko-guards guards|ui|checks`. `package.json`'s `bin` field now points at this new entry instead of `run-guards.ts` alone, so a plain `bunx`/`kumiko-guards` call covers every guard, not just the AST-guard suite.

- 7bc2dd6: Port the last five infra/guards guards

  app-feature-structure, lib-test-coverage, i18n-locale-terminology, feature-integration-tests, and test-stack-drift ported from the private infra/guards package into the public @cosmicdrift/kumiko-guards package. The latter two were rebuilt from ad-hoc infra scripts onto the public RepoCheck pattern; the other three are literal AstGuard ports.

- 6314249: The shared runners (run-guards, run-ui-guards, run-repo-checks) now print a one-line banner before the first guard result (version, guard count, resolved roots, and — where a shared ts-morph project exists — the scanned file count), and abort with a clear error and exit code 1 when zero repo roots resolve or the guard array is empty, instead of silently reporting green. A single guard finding no target repos still only produces its existing per-guard `skipped` line. All remaining German user-visible guard output (console messages, finding messages, remediation hints) across packages/guards/src is now English; comments were left untouched.

### Patch Changes

- 989c3ba: Fix two false-positive findings in the Secret-Literal and Thin-Wrappers guards

  The Secret-Literal Guard flagged secret-fallback patterns documented inside comments: only line-start `//` comments were skipped, so a block-comment line (JSDoc-style `*`, `/*`, `*/`) explaining the rule tripped the guard on its own documentation. Block-comment lines are now recognized as comments too. The Thin-Wrappers Guard misread `/regex/.test(x)` as a call to a function literally named `test`, reporting the enclosing function as a thin wrapper around it. That misclassification no longer fires.

### Minor Changes

- a00154f: Migrate the remaining framework-semantic guards out of the private infra/guards package: complexity, predicate-extraction, i18n-UI-strings, screen-conventions and write-handler-QN guards are now registered in the shared runners as-is, and the as-casts, secret-literal, loadAllEventsByType and table-DDL checks are rebuilt on the public AstGuard/RepoCheck architecture (roots passed as a parameter instead of resolved from a module-global, no more standalone `main()`). Consumers now get these guards from the public package; the framework repo keeps the private package as a devDependency for the maintainer-only checks that stay in infra (doc-status, comment-lang, licenses, agent-manifest and the rest).

- 1e185b5: Adds `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-guards`, a public single-repo port of the infra ts-morph security guards (`admin-api`, `direct-entity-writes`, `direct-fetch`, `escape-hatch-declared`, `no-direct-fs`, `open-to-all-reason`, `tenant-escalation`, `access-denied-test`) plus the shared guard-runner, scan-scope and per-repo security-baseline machinery. `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-repo-manifest` extracts the `kumiko.json` manifest schema and loader out of `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-cli` into its own package, since `kumiko-guards` needs it independently of the CLI. `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-cli` keeps its `./repo-manifest` subpath export unchanged, now re-exporting from the new package.

FloatingPanel widget and r.webSocketRoute

renderer-web gains `FloatingPanel` (movable, resizable, non-modal panel with persisted geometry and a full-screen sheet on narrow viewports) and exports `useIsNarrowViewport`. Features can declare `r.webSocketRoute` under `/api/ws/` with session auth, an Origin check (allowlist, or same host without one), a per-route message cap, backpressure protection (4 MiB, the socket is closed beyond it) and a per-user connection cap (`maxConnectionsPerUser`, default 5, per server process; over it the upgrade gets 429). Handlers run one after another in arrival order per socket. A 25 s heartbeat revalidates session, roles, tenant lifecycle and the token's own expiry (close 1008); a session store that keeps failing closes the socket with 1013 after three failed checks in a row. A server without upgrade wiring answers 501 `websocket_upgrade_not_wired` and logs the fix. `buildBunServeOptions` takes an optional `{ upgradeFetch, heartbeatIntervalMs? }` object as 4th argument and `runProdApp` handles expose `webSocketUpgradeFetch`; the dev server wires it. Upgrade rejections carry the same security headers as other responses. Additive, no migration.

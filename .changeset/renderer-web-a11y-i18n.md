Screen-reader labels in the app shell are translated

<!-- kumiko-changes
feature: renderer-web
type: fix
title: Sidebar, breadcrumb, drawer and table labels for screen readers follow the user's language
detail: The sidebar toggle ("Toggle Sidebar"), the sidebar rail, the title of the mobile sidebar sheet, the breadcrumb landmark, the drawer's close button, the close button of the workspace editor panel and the actions column of tables had hard-coded English names. They now come from the translations in de, en, es, fr and it (`kumiko.sidebar.*`, `kumiko.breadcrumb.label`, `kumiko.list.actions`, `kumiko.dialog.close`).

Event-consumer admin screens, readable audit log, device column for sessions, and a privacy center that keeps its deletion section.

<!-- kumiko-changes
feature: jobs
type: improvement
title: Event consumers screen with restart, skip, pause and resume
detail: SystemAdmins get the screens event-consumers and event-consumer-detail. A stopped consumer offers Restart as the primary action; Skip event (with a confirm dialog), Pause and Resume sit in the overflow menu. The write handlers no longer return the raw error text: unknown consumer, wrong status and nothing to skip have their own codes and messages, anything else is logged on the server and answers a generic message. The shared instance reads "Shared".

<!-- kumiko-changes
feature: audit
type: improvement
title: Audit log shows a label for every event type and hides technical entries
detail: Events that are not entity lifecycle events get a readable label (for example "Custom field value set") or are classified technical (delivery attempts, counters, tenant-destruction stages) and hidden by default behind "Show technical entries". New event types of bundled features need an entry in the audit classification; a test over all registered events fails without one. Apps that add their own event types are unaffected, they keep the entity and action wording or the raw type.

<!-- kumiko-changes
feature: sessions
type: improvement
title: Session lists show the device
detail: The new subpath @cosmicdrift/kumiko-bundled-features/sessions/web exports sessionsClient(). Apps must add sessionsClient() to their client features to get the device column (browser and OS parsed from the user agent) and the translated "This session" cell; without it the screens fall back to the raw columns. The IP display is unchanged.

<!-- kumiko-changes
feature: user-data-rights
type: fix
title: Privacy center keeps the deletion section and speaks to the user
detail: The deletion section only held a conditional field and the request-deletion and cancel-deletion actions, so the renderer dropped it as empty. It now stays whenever it has a visible action. The subtitle is written for the person on the page and names Art. 20, 18 and (when deletion is configured) 17.

<!-- kumiko-changes
feature: framework
type: improvement
title: Consumer admin functions accept a transaction, notIn where operator
detail: restartConsumer, skipPoisonEvent, disableConsumer, enableConsumer and the progress readers accept a DbRunner (pool or open transaction); skipPoisonEvent uses its own transaction on a pool and a savepoint inside a handler transaction. skipPoisonEvent takes { requireStatus } and checks it under its row lock; the consumer-skip handler requires "dead". Rejected transitions throw ConsumerTransitionError with rejection "unknown-consumer" or "wrong-status". Where clauses support { notIn: [...] }. Existing callers passing a DbConnection compile unchanged.
-->

<!-- kumiko-changes
feature: renderer
type: fix
title: A section with a visible action is not hidden when all its fields are
detail: Edit and detail sections (entityEdit, projectionDetail, in every app) whose fields are all hidden by visibility conditions now stay on screen while at least one of their actions is visible. Before, such a section vanished together with its action buttons; apps that relied on that to hide a section must hide the action with its own visible condition.

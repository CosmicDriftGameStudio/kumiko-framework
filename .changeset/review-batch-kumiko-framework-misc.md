Fixes a batch of code-review findings across kumiko-framework/bundled-features/types (PR#1222/1501/1431/1529/1333/1461/1424/1439/1423/1337/1398/1252/1257/1489/1472/1452/1545/1543/1547/1549/1551).

**Breaking:**
- `makeAuthGate(LoginComponent, loginProps, MfaVerifyComponent, MfaSetupComponent)` and `makeSessionAuthGate(...)` (`@cosmicdrift/kumiko-bundled-features/auth-email-password`) now take a single `LoginRouteOptions` object instead of four positional args — the positional signature didn't scale past two optional MFA params. Update call sites to `makeAuthGate({ loginScreen, loginScreenProps, mfaVerifyScreen, mfaSetupScreen })`.

**Fixes (non-breaking):**
- `document-ingest-foundation`'s `documentExtractEntity.pages` column is now `encrypted: true` (stored as serialized JSON in an encrypted `longText` column instead of plaintext `jsonb` — the underlying Postgres column type changes from `jsonb` to `text`) — it held the full extracted text of ingested documents (invoices, IDs, contracts) in plaintext. Apps mounting this feature now need an entity-field-encryption master key configured (same requirement every other PII-encrypted field already has) if they don't already have one. No migration needed: this entity has no writer yet (`#1497` unlanded), so no app has persisted rows against the old `jsonb` shape.
- `reindexEntity()`'s `ReindexEntityResult` gains `wouldIndexRows` — a dry run no longer inflates `indexedRows` (which now stays 0 when nothing was written); also now reports a `failures` entry instead of silently indexing a partial document when a searchable field can't be mapped from the read-table row.
- `UserDataDeleteHook`'s return type now includes bare `void` in the union (previously only `undefined`), so a hook explicitly typed `Promise<void>` (not just a contextually-typed arrow literal) type-checks again.
- `run-forget-cleanup` write-handler's response now includes `incompleteCount`/`incomplete` so operator tooling can see partial-deletion hook results, not just hard failures.
- tenant `invitations`/`members` query handlers: bounded-concurrency (pool-limit 4) PII decrypt instead of a strict sequential loop, and `invitations` no longer decrypts `invitedBy` (a plain userId, never PII-encrypted at write time).
- `packages/framework/src/db/dialect.ts`'s `KUMIKO_NAME_SYMBOL`/`KUMIKO_COLUMNS_SYMBOL`/`KUMIKO_META_SYMBOL` are now imported from `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-types/schema-table-types` everywhere internally instead of being re-declared per call site — `SchemaTable` now also carries `[KUMIKO_META_SYMBOL]`.
- `peerDependencies["@cosmicdrift/kumiko-types"]` changed from `workspace:*` to `workspace:^` in `kumiko-framework`/`kumiko-bundled-features` (a staggered-bump consumer previously got two unresolvable exact peer pins); removed the no-op `peerDependenciesMeta.optional: false`.
- `request-helper`'s `authHeader()` now caches one session id per `(user.id, tenantId)` instead of per `user.id` alone — the same user id holding sessions in two tenants previously got handed the wrong tenant's cached sid.
- `auth-foundation`'s anonymous-access tenant-resolver/tenant-exists merge no longer casts through `as TenantResolver`/`as TenantExists` — the underlying function types were already structurally compatible.
- `isSafeHref` (`@cosmicdrift/kumiko-headless`) now decodes HTML character references (`&colon;`, `&#58;`, `&Tab;`, `&#9;`, ...) before its scheme check — `javascript&colon;alert(1)`/`java&Tab;script:alert(1)` previously slipped through because neither contains a literal `:` for the pre-decode regex, but the browser decodes the entity back into an executable `javascript:` URL on click. Affects `renderSafeMarkdown` (page-render) and the renderer-web `Link` primitive.
- `user-data-rights`'s `restrict-account` write-handler now runs the same cross-tenant membership check as `lift-restriction` — previously any Admin/TenantAdmin (not just SystemAdmin) could restrict a user's account and force-revoke their sessions regardless of tenant, as long as they held an admin role in *some* tenant.
- `dispatch-shared.ts`'s `runStreamInstrumented`: a close-time error from `generator.return()` (e.g. a handler's `finally` failing to release a cursor/unsubscribe) is now folded into the dispatcher error metric and span status when nothing else already failed, instead of being silently discarded; also drops the unused/untested `it.throw()` forwarding branch (no production caller ever calls `.throw()` on a dispatcher stream).
- `event-store.ts`'s `ensureIdempotencyKeyIndex` re-verifies the index is actually valid before treating a caught error as a benign concurrent-build race — a `lock_timeout` during `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (55P03) was being misclassified as "the other pod already built it", silently leaving the idempotency-key uniqueness unenforced.
- `routes.ts`'s SSE `pumpStream`'s finally block and the pre-pull client-abort path no longer `await generator.return(undefined)` — V8 queues that call behind an in-flight `.next()`, so awaiting it could hang the response indefinitely if the handler's pull never settles (e.g. a dead Redis/DB subscription after a client disconnect). Now fire-and-forget, matching the existing `stream.onAbort()` handler's style (which was already fire-and-forget).
- `reindexEntity()` now fails fast with one clear error when a searchable field has no matching read-table column (dropped/never-migrated schema), instead of pushing one identical `failures[]` entry per scanned row.
- `user-data-rights`'s GET `/user-export/by-token?token=` fallback now forwards `x-forwarded-for` to the internal `/api/query` call the same way the POST fragment-exchange route already does — previously every legacy magic-link download collapsed onto request-id-middleware's own (empty/localhost) IP, turning `download-by-token`'s per-IP 30/min rate limit into a single global bucket shared by every user (self-inflicted 429s). Also logs a warning on each hit so ops can see when it's safe to remove (kumiko-framework#1562).

**Missed changesets (retroactively documented, already merged in #1547):**
- `pumpStream`'s exported signature changed: `firstOutcome?: IteratorResult<unknown>` → `firstPull?: Promise<IteratorResult<unknown>>`.
- `validateSessionStoreMultiplicity` no longer throws on zero registered `sessionStore` providers — a pure machine-API deployment (PAT-bearer auth only, no browser sessions) can now mount `auth-foundation` without also mounting `sessions`.
- New public exports: `StreamFrame` (`kumiko-framework`/`-headless`), `isToggleableFeature` (`kumiko-framework`), `parseSseFrames`/`parseSseBlock`/`iterateSseChunks` (`kumiko-dispatcher-live`).

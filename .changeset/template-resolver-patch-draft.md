Template documents can be read as blocks and patched as a draft

<!-- kumiko-changes
feature: template-resolver
type: improvement
title: Read a mail or PDF template as blocks and change it with structured operations
detail: The query `template-resolver:query:document-blocks` returns a document template as blocks with stable ids (b0, b1, ...), its meta, variables, allowed block types and uploaded image keys, plus a `base` (scope and version). The write `template-resolver:write:patch-draft` applies up to 50 operations (insertBlock, replaceText, removeBlock, setResource, setMeta, setVariable) to that state and stores the result as the caller's tenant draft; an active version keeps being served until publish. Block ids refer to the state that was read. If the template changed since `base` was read, the call fails with `version_conflict` and writes nothing; a patch that removes a required placeholder or sets variables a notification declares is refused. `writeTemplateRow` accepts an optional `expectedVersion`. The universal helpers `placeholder-text` and the toolbar block sets moved out of `web/` without changing the web exports.

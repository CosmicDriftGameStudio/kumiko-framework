Fix tenant privilege escalation via membership roles. `hasAccess` checks session roles flat with no notion of origin, so a platform-global role (`SystemAdmin`/`system`) landing in a tenant membership merged into the session and unlocked the SystemAdmin-gated, cross-tenant handler surface — a Tenant-Admin could invite `SystemAdmin` and the invitee gained platform-wide, cross-tenant access.

Reject reserved/global roles (`system`, `SystemAdmin`, `all`, `anonymous`) at every tenant-membership write chokepoint: `seedTenantMembership` (covers the three invite-accept branches plus seeding), `add-member`, `update-member-roles`, and early in `invite-create`. The bootstrap path was already correct (SystemAdmin lives in global `users.roles`, never in a membership); this makes the invite path consistent.

Also centralize the `tenantIdOverride` SystemAdmin gate into a new `crossTenantOverrideDenied` helper (exported from `@cosmicdrift/kumiko-framework/engine`), replacing the inline check duplicated across managed-pages, compliance-profiles, text-content and template-resolver so a future override handler can't skip it.
